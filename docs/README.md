Some arguments can be explained a little bit more:

- [**:bomb: Fail-Safe**](FailSafe.md): an explanation of how the fail-safe mechanism works
- [**:level_slider: Options**](Options.md): everything about the available options, both cache-wide and per-call
- [**:stopwatch: Timeouts**](Timeouts.md): the various types of timeouts at your disposal (calling a factory, using the distributed cache, etc)
- [**:trophy: Step By Step**](StepByStep.md): a complete step by step example of why a cache is useful, why FusionCache could be even more so, how to apply most of the options available and what results you can expect to obtain
