# ü¶Ñ A Gentle Introduction

FusionCache is an easy to use, fast and robust cache with advanced resiliency features and an optional distributed 2nd layer.

It uses a memory cache (any impl of the standard `IMemoryCache` interface) as the **primary** backing store and, optionally, a distributed cache (any impl of the standard `IDistributedCache` interface) as a **secondary** backing store for better resilience and higher performance, for example in a multi-node scenario or to avoid the typical effects of a cold start (initial empty cache, maybe after a restart).

Optionally, it can also use a **backplane**: in a multi-node scenario this will send notifications to the other nodes to keep each node's memory cache perfectly synchronized, without any additional work.

FusionCache also includes some advanced features like a **fail-safe** mechanism, **cache stampede** prevention, fine grained **soft/hard timeouts** with **background factory completion**, customizable **extensive logging** and more (see below).

## üè† Feels Like Home

FusionCache tries to feel like a native part of .NET by adhering to the naming conventions of the standard **memory** and **distributed** cache components:

|                               | Memory Cache                | Distributed Cache              | Fusion Cache              |
| ---:                          | :---:                       | :---:                          | :---:                     |
| **Cache Interface**           | `IMemoryCache`              | `IDistributedCache`            | `IFusionCache`            |
| **Cache Implementation**      | `MemoryCache`               | `[Various]Cache`               | `FusionCache`             |
| **Cache Options**             | `MemoryCacheOptions`        | `[Various]CacheOptions`        | `FusionCacheOptions`      |
| **Cache Entry Options**       | `MemoryCacheEntryOptions`   | `DistributedCacheEntryOptions` | `FusionCacheEntryOptions` |

If you've ever used one of those you'll feel at home with FusionCache.


## üîÄ Cache Levels ([more](CacheLevels.md))

There are 2 caching levels, transparently handled by FusionCache for you.

These are:
- **1Ô∏è‚É£ Primary**: it's a memory cache, is always there and is used to have a very fast access to data in memory, with high data locality. You can give FusionCache any implementation of `IMemoryCache` or let FusionCache create one for you
- **2Ô∏è‚É£ Secondary**: is an *optional* distributed cache (any implementation of `IDistributedCache` will work) and, since it's not strictly necessary and it serves the purpose of **easing a cold start** or **coordinating with other nodes**, it is treated differently than the primary one. This means that any potential error happening on this level (remember the [fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing) ?) can be automatically handled by FusionCache to not impact the overall application, all while (optionally) logging any detail of it for further investigation

Everything is handled transparently for you.

You can read more [**here**](CacheLevels.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## üì¢ Backplane ([more](Backplane.md))

If you are in a scenario with multiple nodes, each with their own local memory cache, you typically also use a distributed cache as a secondary layer (see above).

Even using that, you may find that each memory cache may not be necessarily in-sync with the others, because when a value is cached locally it will stay the same until the `Duration` passes and expiration occurs.

To avoid this and have everything always synchronized you can use a backplane, a shared message bus where change notifications will be automatically sent to all other connected nodes each time a value changes in the cache, without you having to do anything.

You can read more [**here**](Backplane.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## üöÄ Factory ([more](CacheStampede.md))

A factory is just a function that you specify when using the main `GetOrSet[Async]` method: basically it's the way you specify **how to get a value** when it's needed.

Here's an example:

```csharp
var id = 42;

var product = cache.GetOrSet<Product>(
    $"product:{id}",
    _ => GetProductFromDb(id), // THIS IS THE FACTORY
    options => options.SetDuration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1))
);
```

FusionCache will search for the value in the cache (*memory* and *distributed*, if available) and, if nothing is there, will call the factory to obtain the value: it then saves it into the cache with the specified options, and returns it to the caller, all transparently.

Special care has been put into ensuring that **only 1** factory per-key will be executed concurrently, to avoid what is known as [Cache Stampede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede).

You can read more [**here**](CacheStampede.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## üí£ Fail-Safe ([more](FailSafe.md))

Sometimes things can go wrong, and calling a factory for an expired cache entry can lead to exceptions because the database or the network is temporarily down: normally in this case the exception will cause an error page in your website, a failure status code in your api or something like that.

By enabling the fail-safe mechanism you can simply tell FusionCache to ignore those errors and **temporarily use the expired cache entry**: your website or service will remain online, and your users would not notice anything.

You can read more [**here**](FailSafe.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeouts ([more](Timeouts.md))

Sometimes your data source (database, webservice, etc) is overloaded, the network is congested or something else is happening, and the end result is a **long wait** for a fresh piece of data.

Wouldn't it be nice if there could be a way to simply let FusionCache temporarily reuse an expired cache entry if the factory is taking too long?

Enter **soft/hard timeouts**.

You can specify a **soft timeout** to be used if there's an expired cache entry to use as a fallback, and a **hard timeout** to be used in any case, no matter what: in this last case an exception will be thrown and you will have to handle it yourself, but in some cases that would be more preferable than a very slow response.

In both cases it is possible (and enabled *by default*, so you don't have to do anything) to let the timed-out factory keep running in the background, and update the cached value as soon as it finishes, so you get the best of both worlds: a **fast response** and **fresh data** as soon as possible.

You can read more [**here**](Timeouts.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## üéöÔ∏è Options ([more](Options.md))

There are 2 kinds of options:
 
 - `FusionCacheOptions`: cache-wide options, related to the entire FusionCache instance
 - `FusionCacheEntryOptions`: per-entry options, related to each method call/entry

You can read more [**here**](Options.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## üïπÔ∏è Core Methods ([more](CoreMethods.md))

At a high level there are 5 core methods:

- `Set[Async]`
- `Remove[Async]`
- `TryGet[Async]`
- `GetOrDefault[Async]`
- `GetOrSet[Async]`

All of them work **on both the memory cache and the distributed cache** (if any) in a transparent way: you don't have to do anything extra for it to coordinate the 2 layers.

All of them are available in both a **sync** and an **async** version.

Finally, most of them have a set of ‚ôª overloads for a better ease of use.

You can read more [**here**](CoreMethods.md).


## üí´ Natively Sync + Async

Everything is natively available for both the **sync** and **async** programming models.

Any operation works seamlessly with any other, even if one is **sync** and the other is **async**: an example is multiple concurrent factory calls for the same cache key, some of them **sync** while others **async**, all coordinated together at the same time with no problems and a guarantee that only one will be executed at the same time.

## üîÉ Dependency Injection ([more](DependencyInjection.md))

FusionCache fully supports [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection), a design pattern to achieve a form of Inversion of Control (IoC) in our code.

It also supports the modern and easy to use Builder approach.

You can read more [**here**](DependencyInjection.md), or enjoy the complete [**step by step**](StepByStep.md) guide.


## üìõ Named Caches ([more](NamedCaches.md))

Just like with the standard [named http clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests?view=aspnetcore-7.0#named-clients) in .NET, with FusionCache it's possible to have multiple named caches.

Thanks to the native [builder](DependencyInjection.md) support, it's very easy to configure different caches identified by different names.

You can read more [**here**](NamedCaches.md).


## üìû Events ([more](Events.md))

There's a comprehensive set of events to subscribe to regarding core events inside of a FusionCache instance, both at a high level and at lower levels (memory/distributed layers).

You can read more [**here**](Events.md).


## üß© Plugins ([more](Plugins.md))

FusionCache supports extensibility via plugins: it is possible for example to listen to [events](Events.md) and react in any way you want.

In time, the most useful plugins will be listed directly in the homepage.

You can read more [**here**](Plugins.md).


## üìú Logging ([more](Logging.md))

FusionCache can log extensively to help you pinpoint any possible problem in your production environment.

It uses the standard `ILogger<T>` interface and a structured logging approach so it fits well in the .NET ecosystem, allowing you to use any implementation you want that is compatible with it (Serilog, NLog, etc): it also has a series of settings you may find useful to better tune its behavior.

You can read more [**here**](Logging.md).
