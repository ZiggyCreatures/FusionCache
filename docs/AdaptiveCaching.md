# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Adaptive Caching

| ‚ö° TL;DR (quick version) |
| -------- |
| It's possible to change entry options in-flight, inside of a factory, to make them adapt specifically to the value being cached. Just use the factory signature with the context and the cancellation token. |

Sometimes when you are caching a piece of data with the `GetOrSet` method you don't know upfront what the cache duration should be: this may happen because the cache duration depends on the object being cached itself.

Some examples may be:

- **üì∞ news articles**: a fresh article that has just been published on a news site may very well receive some updates very soon, maybe because it has been published very fast to get a news out but then some typos have been found or a slight change is needed. In this case it would be nice to be able to cache fresh content for a low amount of time like `30 sec` or `1 min`, whereas an old article that has not been touched for a year may very well be cached for like `10 min` or more, because it will be very unlikely that a quick update will be needed after all this time
- **üîë auth tokens**: auth tokens or similar pieces of data typically have an associated expiration, and it would be nice to cache them accordingly
- **üåç HTTP api results**: if your remote data source is not a database but, for example, an HTTP service like a rest endpoint the HTTP response may contain caching-related informations in the form of the `Cache-Control` HTTP header, which in turns typically contains the `max-age` directive. It would be nice to use that as the duration for the cache, respecting the service specification for how much a piece of data should be cached

The problem in all these cases is that when you call `GetOrSet` you'll provide both the factory (the function to be executed to get the data) and some options for that call (via `FusionCacheEntryOptions`), but as we said some of the options (eg: the `Duration`) may depend on the result of the factory, which has not run yet.

It seems like a chicken and egg problem, right?

Thankfully we have a solution: enter **adaptive caching**.


## üë©‚Äçüè´ How it works

When calling `GetOrSet` you can choose different overloads, and the ones with a factory are available in 2 factory flavors: one with a *context* (of type `FusionCacheFactoryExecutionContext`) and one without it.

In the ones **with** the context you can simply change the context's `Options` property however you like.

Here are 2 examples, with and without the *context* object.


### üë©‚Äçüíª Example: without adaptive caching

As you can see we are specifying the factory as a lambda that takes as input only a cancellation token `ct` (of type `CancellationToken`) and nothing else.

```csharp
var id = 42;

// WITHOUT ADAPTIVE CACHING: THE DURATION IS FIXED TO 1 MIN
var product = cache.GetOrSet<Product>(
    $"product:{id}",
    ct => GetProductFromDb(id, ct),
    options => options.SetDuration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)) // FIXED: 1 MIN
);
```

### üë©‚Äçüíª Example: with adaptive caching

As you can see we are specifying the factory as a lambda that takes as input both a context `ctx` (of type `FusionCacheFactoryExecutionContext`) and a cancellation token `ct` (of type `CancellationToken`), so that we are able to change the options inside the factory itself.

```csharp
var id = 42;

// WITH ADAPTIVE CACHING: THE DURATION DEPENDS ON THE OBJECT BEING CACHED
var product = cache.GetOrSet<Product>(
    $"product:{id}",
    (ctx, ct) => {
        var product = GetProductFromDb(id, ct);

        if (product is null) {
            // CACHE null FOR 5 minutes
            ctx.Options.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
        } else if (product.LastUpdatedAt > DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1)) {
            // CACHE PRODUCTS UPDATED IN THE LAST DAY FOR 1 MIN
            ctx.Options.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
        } else if (product.LastUpdatedAt > DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-10)) {
            // CACHE PRODUCTS UPDATED IN THE LAST 10 DAYS FOR 10 MIN
            ctx.Options.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
        } else {
            // CACHE ANY OLDER PRODUCT FOR 30 MIN
            ctx.Options.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
        }

        return product;
    },
    options => options.SetDuration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)) // DEFAULT: 1 MIN
);
```

You may change other options too, like the `Priority` for example.

Of course ther are some changes that wouldn't make much sense: if for example we change the `FactorySoftTimeout` after the factory has been already executed we shouldn't expect much to happen, right üòÖ ?


## ‚è± Timeouts & Background Factory Completion

Short version: everything works as expected!

Longer version: there are times when, if a factory is taking a lot of time to complete (because maybe the database is overloaded or there's a temporary network congestion), you would prefer stale data very fast instead of fresh data but slowly.

A nice feature of FusionCache is the ability to set soft/hard [timeouts](Timeouts.md) to get the best of both worlds: an always fast response with fresh data as soon as possible. As we know when a timeout kicks in, the running factory is not stopped but kept running in the background.

A question we may ask ourselves is if adaptive caching would still work in that scenario.

The answer is **absolutely yes**: you don't need to change anything, do extra steps or give up on some features üéâ
