# 📺 Media

I've been lucky enough to have been invited to some lives, podcasts and shows to talk about caching and FusionCache.

If you are more into videos than text, here's a list you may enjoy.

## English Language




### On .NET (2024)

The fine folks at [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) have been kind enough to invite me on the show and listen to me mumbling random caching stuff.

This is a very good introduction on the general approach and features of FusionCache, but also a useful overview of caching concepts in general.

Thanks Alberto!
