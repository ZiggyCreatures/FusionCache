I've been lucky enough to have been invited to some lives, podcasts and shows to talk about caching and FusionCache.

### On .NET (2024)

The fine folks at [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) have been kind enough to invite me on the show and listen to me mumbling random caching stuff.

This is a very good introduction on the general approach and features of FusionCache, but also a useful overview of caching concepts in general.

### Continuous Delivery (2024)

The fine folks at Continuous Delivery (by [SparkFabrik](https://www.sparkfabrik.com/it/)) invited me to talk about my experience with open source in general, and FusionCache in particular.

### Spike Time (2024)

[Alberto Mori](https://twitter.com/albx87) invited me on his Spike Time, where I've been able to see him move his first steps with FusionCache, live, unfiltered. A really nice experience that also ended up making FusionCache even better.

Thanks Alberto!
