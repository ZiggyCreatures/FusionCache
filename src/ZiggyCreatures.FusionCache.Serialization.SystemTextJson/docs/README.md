### FusionCache is an easy to use, high performance and robust cache with an optional distributed 2nd layer and some advanced features.

## 📦 This package

This package is an implementation for a FusionCache serializer to be used with the optional distributed cache layer, based on [System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-how-to).
