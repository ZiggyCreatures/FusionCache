## FusionCache is an easy to use, fast and robust hybrid cache with advanced resiliency features.

It was born after years of dealing with all sorts of different types of caches: memory caching, distributed caching, http caching, CDNs, browser cache, offline cache, you name it.

So I tried to put together these experiences and came up with FusionCache.

![FusionCache diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/main/docs/images/diagram.png)

Being a hybrid cache means it can transparently work as either a normal memory cache (L1) or as a multi-level cache (L1+L2), where the distributed 2nd level (L2) can be any implementation of the standard `IDistributedCache` interface: this will get us better cold starts, better horizontal scalability, more resiliency and overall better performance.

FusionCache also includes an optional [backplane](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Backplane.md) for realtime sync between multiple nodes and advanced resiliency features like [cache stampede](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheStampede.md) protection, a [fail-safe](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/FailSafe.md) mechanism, [soft/hard timeouts](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Timeouts.md), [eager refresh](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/EagerRefresh.md), full observability via [logging](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Logging.md) and [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/OpenTelemetry.md), [tagging](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Tagging.md) and much more.

It's being used in production on real-world projects with huge volumes for years, and is even used by Microsoft itself in its products like [Data API Builder](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/data-api-builder-ga/).

It's also compatible with the new HybridCache from Microsoft, thanks to a [powerful integration](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/MicrosoftHybridCache.md).

## 📺 Media

More into videos?

I've been lucky enough to be invited on some shows and podcasts here and there: you can find them in the [Media](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Media.md) section.

A good example is when the fine folks at [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) invited me on the show to allow me to mumbling random caching stuff.

## ✔ Features

FusionCache has a lot of features, let's see them grouped together:

#### Resiliency
- [**🛡️ Cache Stampede**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheStampede.md): automatic protection from the Cache Stampede problem
- [**💣 Fail-Safe**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/FailSafe.md): a mechanism to avoids transient failures, by reusing an expired entry as a temporary fallback
- [**↩️ Auto-Recovery**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AutoRecovery.md): self-healing for the entire cache, all automatically

#### Performance & Scalability
- [**🔀 L1+L2**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheLevels.md): any implementation of `IDistributedCache` can be used as an optional 2nd level, all transparently
- [**📢 Backplane**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Backplane.md): in a multi-node scenario, it can notify the other nodes about changes in the cache, so all will be in-sync
- [**⏱ Soft/Hard Timeouts**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Timeouts.md): a slow factory (or distributed cache) will not slow down your application, and no data will be wasted
- [**🦅 Eager Refresh**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/EagerRefresh.md): start a non-blocking background refresh before the expiration occurs
- [**🔂 Conditional Refresh**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/ConditionalRefresh.md): like HTTP Conditional Requests, but for caching
- [**🚀 Background Distributed Operations**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/BackgroundDistributedOperations.md): distributed operations can easily be executed in the background, safely, for better performance

#### Flexibility
- [**📛 Named Caches**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/NamedCaches.md): easily work with multiple named caches, even if differently configured
- [**🏷️ Tagging**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Tagging.md): tags can be associated to entries, to later expire them all at once
- [**🧼 Clear**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Clear.md): clear an entire cache, even with shared L2, cache key prefix, etc
- [**Ⓜ️ Microsoft HybridCache**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/MicrosoftHybridCache.md): can be used as an implementation of the new HybridCache abstraction from Microsoft, all while adding extra features
- [**🧙‍♂️ Adaptive Caching**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AdaptiveCaching.md): for when you don't know upfront the entry options (eg: `Duration`), since they depends on the value being cached itself
- [**🔃 Dependency Injection + Builder**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/DependencyInjection.md): native support for Dependency Injection, with a nice fluent interface including a Builder support
- [**♊ Auto-Clone**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AutoClone.md): be sure that cached values returned can be safely modified
- [**💫 Fully sync/async**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CoreMethods.md): native support for both the synchronous and asynchronous programming model
- [**🧩 Plugins**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Plugins.md): extend FusionCache with additional behavior like adding support for metrics, statistics, etc...

#### Observability
- [**🔭 OpenTelemetry**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/OpenTelemetry.md): native observability support via OpenTelemetry
- [**📜 Logging**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Logging.md): comprehensive, structured and customizable, via the standard `ILogger` interface
- [**📞 Events**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Events.md): a comprehensive set of events, both at a high level and at lower levels (memory/distributed)

## ⭐ Quick Start

Just install the `ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache` Nuget package:

```PowerShell
PM> Install-Package ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache
```

Then, let's say we have a method that loads a product from the database:

```csharp
Product GetProductFromDb(int id) {
	// DATABASE CALL HERE
}
```

(This is using the **sync** programming model, but it would be equally valid with the newer **async** one)

Then we create a FusionCache instance:

```csharp
var cache = new FusionCache(new FusionCacheOptions());
```

or, if using [dependency injection](docs/DependencyInjection.md):

```csharp
services.AddFusionCache();
```

Now, to get the product from the cache and, if not there, get it from the database in an optimized way and cache it for `30 sec`:

```csharp
var id = 42;

cache.GetOrSet<Product>(
	$"product:{id}",
	_ => GetProductFromDb(id),
	TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
);
```

That's it.

## 🖥️ Simulator

Distributed systems are, in general, quite complex to understand.

When using FusionCache with the [distributed cache](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheLevels.md), the [backplane](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Backplane.md) and [auto-recovery](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AutoRecovery.md) the Simulator can help us **seeing** the whole picture.

## 🧰 Supported Platforms

FusionCache targets `.NET Standard 2.0` so any compatible .NET implementation is fine: this means `.NET Framework` (the old one), `.NET Core 2+` and `.NET 5/6+` (the new ones), `Mono` 5.4+ and more (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) for a complete rundown).

**NOTE**: if you are running on **.NET Framework 4.6.1** and want to use **.NET Standard** packages Microsoft suggests to upgrade to .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher (see the [.NET Standard Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support)) to avoid some known dependency issues.

## 🆎 Comparison

There are various alternatives out there with different features, different performance characteristics (cpu/memory) and in general a different set of pros/cons.

A [feature comparison](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Comparison.md) between existing .NET caching solutions may help you choose which one to use.

## 💼 Is it Production Ready :tm: ?

Yes!

FusionCache is being used **in production** on **real world projects** for years, happily handling billions of requests.

Considering that the FusionCache packages have been downloaded more than **10 million times** (thanks everybody!) it may very well be used even more.

Oh, and it is being used in products by Microsoft itself, like [Data API Builder](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/data-api-builder-ga/)!

## 💰 Support

Nothing to do here.

After years of using a lot of open source stuff for free, this is just me trying to give something back to the community.
