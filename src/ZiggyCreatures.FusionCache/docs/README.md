## FusionCache is an easy to use, fast and robust hybrid cache with advanced resiliency features.

It was born after years of dealing with all sorts of different types of caches: memory caching, distributed caching, http caching, CDNs, browser cache, offline cache, you name it. So I've tried to put together these experiences and came up with FusionCache.

Being a hybrid cache means that it can work both as a normal memory cache (L1) or, optionally, as a multi-level cache (L1+L2) where the 2nd level can be any implementation of the standard `IDistributedCache` interface. This will get us better better scalability, better performance and more resiliency in a multi-node scenario or even just to ease cold starts (initial empty cache, maybe after a restart).

Optionally, it can also use a **backplane**: in a multi-node scenario this will send notifications to the other nodes to keep each node's memory cache perfectly synchronized, without any additional work.

FusionCache also includes some advanced resiliency features like a **fail-safe** mechanism, **cache stampede** prevention, fine grained **soft/hard timeouts** with **background factory completion**, customizable **extensive logging** and more (see below).

## 📺 Media

More into videos?

I've been lucky enough to be invited on some shows and podcasts here and there: you can find them in the [Media](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Media.md) section.

A good example is when the fine folks at [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) invited me on the show to allow me to mumbling random caching stuff.

## ✔ Features
These are the **key features** of FusionCache:

- [**🛡️ Cache Stampede**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheStampede.md): automatic protection from the Cache Stampede problem
- [**🔀 2nd level**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheLevels.md): an optional 2nd level handled transparently, with any implementation of `IDistributedCache`
- [**💣 Fail-Safe**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/FailSafe.md): a mechanism to avoids transient failures, by reusing an expired entry as a temporary fallback
- [**⏱ Soft/Hard Timeouts**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Timeouts.md): a slow factory (or distributed cache) will not slow down your application, and no data will be wasted
- [**📢 Backplane**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Backplane.md): in a multi-node scenario, it can notify the other nodes about changes in the cache, so all will be in-sync
- [**↩️ Auto-Recovery**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AutoRecovery.md): automatic handling of transient issues with retries and sync logic
- [**🧙‍♂️ Adaptive Caching**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AdaptiveCaching.md): for when you don't know upfront the cache duration, as it depends on the value being cached itself
- [**🔂 Conditional Refresh**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/ConditionalRefresh.md): like HTTP Conditional Requests, but for caching
- [**🦅 Eager Refresh**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/EagerRefresh.md): start a non-blocking background refresh before the expiration occurs
- [**🔃 Dependency Injection + Builder**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/DependencyInjection.md): native support for Dependency Injection, with a nice fluent interface including a Builder support
- [**📛 Named Caches**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/NamedCaches.md): easily work with multiple named caches, even if differently configured
- [**🔭 OpenTelemetry**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/OpenTelemetry.md): native observability support via OpenTelemetry
- [**🚀 Background Distributed Operations**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/BackgroundDistributedOperations.md): distributed operations can easily be executed in the background, safely, for better performance
- [**📜 Logging**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Logging.md): comprehensive, structured and customizable, via the standard `ILogger` interface
- [**💫 Fully sync/async**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CoreMethods.md): native support for both the synchronous and asynchronous programming model
- [**📞 Events**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Events.md): a comprehensive set of events, both at a high level and at lower levels (memory/distributed)
- [**🧩 Plugins**](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Plugins.md): extend FusionCache with additional behavior like adding support for metrics, statistics, etc...

## ⭐ Quick Start

FusionCache can be installed via the nuget UI (search for the `ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache` package) or via the nuget package manager console:

```PowerShell
PM> Install-Package ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache
```

As an example, imagine having a method that retrieves a product from your database:

```csharp
Product GetProductFromDb(int id) {
	// YOUR DATABASE CALL HERE
}
```

💡 This is using the **sync** programming model, but it would be equally valid with the newer **async** one for even better performance.

To start using FusionCache the first thing is create a cache instance:

```csharp
var cache = new FusionCache(new FusionCacheOptions());
```

If instead you are using **DI (Dependency Injection)** use this:

```csharp
services.AddFusionCache();
```

We can also specify some global options, like a default `FusionCacheEntryOptions` object to serve as a default for each call we'll make, with a duration of `2 minutes` and a `Low` priority:

```csharp
var cache = new FusionCache(new FusionCacheOptions() {
	DefaultEntryOptions = new FusionCacheEntryOptions {
		Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2),
		Priority = CacheItemPriority.Low
	}
});
```

Or, using DI, like this:

```csharp
services.AddFusionCache()
	.WithDefaultEntryOptions(new FusionCacheEntryOptions {
		Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2),
		Priority = CacheItemPriority.Low
	})
;
```

Now, to get the product from the cache and, if not there, get it from the database in an optimized way and cache it for `30 sec` simply do this:

```csharp
var id = 42;

cache.GetOrSet<Product>(
	$"product:{id}",
	_ => GetProductFromDb(id),
	TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
);
```

That's it 🎉

## 🖥️ Simulator

Distributed systems are, in general, quite complex to understand.

When using FusionCache with the [distributed cache](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/CacheLevels.md), the [backplane](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/Backplane.md) and [auto-recovery](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AutoRecovery.md) the Simulator can help us **seeing** the whole picture.

## 🧰 Supported Platforms

FusionCache targets `.NET Standard 2.0` so any compatible .NET implementation is fine: this means `.NET Framework` (the old one), `.NET Core 2+` and `.NET 5/6+` (the new ones), `Mono` 5.4+ and more (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) for a complete rundown).

**NOTE**: if you are running on **.NET Framework 4.6.1** and want to use **.NET Standard** packages Microsoft suggests to upgrade to .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher (see the [.NET Standard Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support)) to avoid some known dependency issues.

## 💼 Is it Production Ready :tm: ?

Yes!

FusionCache is being used **in production** on **real world projects** for years, happily handling millions of requests.

Considering that the FusionCache packages have been downloaded more than **4 million times** (thanks everybody!) it may very well be used even more.

And again, if you are using it please [**✉ drop me a line**](https://twitter.com/jodydonetti), I'd like to know!
