### FusionCache is an easy to use, high performance and robust cache with an optional distributed 2nd layer and some advanced features.

It was born after years of dealing with all sorts of different types of caches: memory caching, distributed caching, http caching, CDNs, browser cache, offline cache, you name it. So I've tried to put together these experiences and came up with FusionCache.

## 📦 This package

This package is an implementation for a FusionCache serializer to be used with the optional distributed cache layer, based on the fast new serializer by Neuecc, [MemoryPack](https://github.com/Cysharp/MemoryPack).
